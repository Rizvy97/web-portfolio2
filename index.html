            <p style="color:dimgray;font-size:20px;"> I started my journey of life in the early 90’s and ever since I have been up against barriers and met many different types of characters.  All with their personal gain is put first without a thought for others.</p>

            <p style="color:dimgray;font-size:20px;"> Anyways let’s start from the beginning, I started my educational career in 1997 at welbourne primary school/ boy was it fun it had everything a kid could ever imagine, a massive sand box, shiny new tricycles, super fast scooters and loads and loads of coloured paint. It was unbelievable we were given milk and cookies and we got to sing as well as the fundamental steps of life, the alphabet and numbers.</p>
